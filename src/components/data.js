    title: "SICARAN BATTLE TANK",
    desc: "This is a mighty Sicaran Battle Tank of the Imperial Fists from the Horus Heresy. This Imperial Fists army that I painted for Warhammer 30,000 was the first yellow army Iâ€™ve had the pleasure to paint.  The weathering is a combination of washes and pigments alongside an airbrush and a sponge.",

    title: "IRON HANDS SPACE MARINES",
    desc: "This Iron Hands Space Marines army was a recent quarantine project. I envisioned an army of classic marine Iron Hand army choices but in a modern era of 9th Edition Warhammer 40,000. I went with a combination of iconic dreadnoughts with the newly released primaris. I attempted the classic matte black with a silver trim for the Iron Hands accompanied with an overgrown wasteland basing scheme.",

    title: "FROSTGRAVE TERRAIN",
    desc: "This is 4x4 foot terrain table for Frostgrave, Dungeons & Dragons, and MageKnight.  What started as a Christmas present from my friend John (The Garden of Morr from Gamesworkshop) turned into a fantastic bloodbourne inspired grave site. This spooky autumn sanctuary is four modular 2x2 foot stackable tiles accompanied by a large amount of cathedral ruin. The corroded gates and grim statues really bring the table to life!",

    desc: "Hive Fleet Orion is back again under a new scheme of a black beetle carapace. A classic Kraken splinter fleet from 4th edition 40k was repainted with a new look for 9th edition. I brought the color scheme to life with purples, pinks, and a striking jungle basing scheme throughout the updated models. The Tyranids are a seemingly forever personal project of mine.",

    desc: "A 5x4 Wargaming table for that represents an overgrown and abandoned city in the universe of Dropzone Commander. The 10mm structures are built from a majority of HWG resin foamcore, and cardstock. The modular overpass is from Blotz (uk) 10mm Custom Lasercut.",
